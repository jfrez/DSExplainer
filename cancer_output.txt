The tumor is predicted to be malignant. High Certainty and Plausibility scores indicate strong support for malignancy, with the most influential features including the combination of mean concave points (0.03821) and worst radius (14.97), texture (24.64), and perimeter (96.05), which align with elevated malignancy markers. The plausibility triple involving worst radius, perimeter, and area (677.9) further reinforces this classification, as these values significantly exceed mean measurements, reflecting increased tumor aggressiveness. The low uncertainty (2.08%) and high confidence in these feature combinations confirm the classification. The tumor is predicted to be malignant.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
The tumor is predicted to be benign. High plausibility (78.04%) is associated with the combination of worst radius (24.86), worst perimeter (165.9), and worst concave points (0.1789), which align with benign tumor characteristics. The mean concave points (0.0795) further support this classification, as lower concave points are typically observed in benign cases. While the certainty triple involving mean concave points, worst radius, and worst texture (10.55%) indicates moderate confidence, the dominant plausibility metric strongly aligns with benign features. The low uncertainty value (2.08%) and the model's prediction of 0.0 confirm the classification. The tumor is predicted to be benign.

The tumor is predicted to be benign. The highest plausibility score (86.13%) is associated with the combination of worst radius (19.26), worst texture (26.0), and worst perimeter (124.9), which align with lower malignancy indicators, as these values fall within the range typically observed in benign tumors. The mean concave points (0.08087) and concavity (0.1466) are relatively low, further supporting benign classification. While the certainty triple involving mean concave points and worst radius/texture (12.36%) and worst radius/perimeter/smoothness (10.82%) indicates moderate confidence, the dominant plausibility metrics strongly align with benign characteristics. The low uncertainty (2.08%) and overall favorable feature profiles confirm the classification. The tumor is predicted to be benign.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
The tumor is predicted to be malignant. High plausibility (84.29%) is associated with the combination of worst radius (12.88), worst perimeter (89.61), and worst area (515.8), which are significantly elevated compared to mean values (radius=12.4, perimeter=81.47, area=467.8). These higher worst-case measurements, particularly in perimeter and area, align with malignancy indicators in breast cancer data. While certainty triples involving mean concave points and worst texture/perimeter/smoothness contribute lower confidence (14.51%, 9.08%, 7.15%), the dominant plausibility metric strongly supports malignancy. The low uncertainty (2.08%) further reinforces this classification. The tumor is predicted to be malignant.

The tumor is predicted to be malignant. High plausibility scores (79.86%) for the combination of worst radius, worst perimeter, and worst area, along with significant certainty (11.05%) in mean concave points, worst radius, and worst texture, indicate strong alignment with malignant characteristics. The elevated worst radius (12.26), perimeter (78.78), and area (457.8) contrast with lower mean concave points (0.02594), suggesting a higher likelihood of malignancy. The low uncertainty (2.08%) and model prediction (1.0) further confirm this classification. The tumor is predicted to be benign.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
The tumor is predicted to be benign. The highest plausibility triple, involving worst radius (25.74), worst texture (39.42), and worst area (1821.0), indicates strong alignment with benign characteristics, as these values fall within the range typical for non-malignant tumors. While the certainty triple with mean concave points (0.152) and worst radius/texture (25.74/39.42) suggests moderate confidence, the overall plausibility scores and low uncertainty (2.08%) strongly support the benign classification. The combination of elevated worst features, particularly area and texture, aligns with benign patterns, and the model’s prediction of 0.0 confirms this conclusion. The tumor is predicted to be benign.

The tumor is predicted to be benign. The plausibility triple involving area error (61.1), worst radius (20.01), and worst perimeter (134.9) exhibits the highest score (82.17%), indicating strong alignment with benign characteristics despite the high area error. The worst radius and perimeter values, which are elevated compared to their mean counterparts (17.57 and 115.0), align with benign patterns, while the low certainty triples (e.g., 12.94% for worst radius, perimeter, and smoothness) suggest less definitive evidence for malignancy. The overall prediction of 0.06 with 2.08% uncertainty further supports benign classification, as the high plausibility metrics outweigh the lower certainty indicators.

The tumor is predicted to be malignant. The plausibility triples, particularly the combination of worst radius (15.53), worst texture (23.19), and worst perimeter (96.66), exhibit the highest scores (81.74%), aligning with known malignancy indicators where these features are significantly elevated. While the certainty triple involving mean concave points, worst radius, and worst texture (15.36%) also supports malignancy, the dominant plausibility metrics strongly suggest a malignant classification based on the high consistency of worst-case feature values. The 0.72 prediction probability further reinforces this conclusion.

--- LLM RESPONSE ---
The tumor is predicted to be malignant. High plausibility (78.11%) is associated with the combination of worst radius (15.14), worst perimeter (101.2), and worst area (718.9), which are significantly elevated compared to mean values (radius: 13.9, perimeter: 88.97, area: 599.4), indicating aggressive tumor growth. Certainty (10.40%) is linked to mean concave points (0.01339) and worst radius (15.14) alongside worst texture (21.8), reflecting increased irregularity. These metrics, along with the 2.08% uncertainty, strongly align with malignant classification. The tumor is predicted to be malignant.
