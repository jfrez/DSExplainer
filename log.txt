The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the famous ship.
Each row represents a passenger and includes variables such as ticket class
(`pclass`), sex, age, number of siblings/spouses (`sibsp`) and parents/
children (`parch`) aboard, the fare paid, cabin, and embarkation port. The
target variable is `survived`, indicating whether the passenger lived.

Objective: briefly conclude why the passenger survived or not. Only provide the final conclusion based on SHAP feature importances.
Columns: pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked
Prediction for row 0: survived
Top SHAP features: age, fare, cabin

LLM SHAP interpretation for row 15 (English):
The passenger did not survive due to high age, low fare, and lack of cabin, as these top SHAP features strongly contributed to the non-survival prediction.

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the famous ship.
Each row represents a passenger and includes variables such as ticket class
(`pclass`), sex, age, number of siblings/spouses (`sibsp`) and parents/
children (`parch`) aboard, the fare paid, cabin, and embarkation port. The
target variable is `survived`, indicating whether the passenger lived.

Objective: briefly conclude why the passenger survived or not. Only provide the final conclusion based on Certainty and Plausibility.
Columns: pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked
Prediction for row 15: did not survive
Certainty triples: sex_x_age_x_fare, pclass_x_sex_x_age, pclass_x_age_x_fare
Plausibility triples: age_x_fare_x_cabin, age_x_ticket_x_fare, age_x_parch_x_fare

LLM Dempster interpretation for row 15 (English):
The passenger did not survive due to the combination of being male (sex), older (age), and paying a lower fare (fare), which aligns with the certainty triple `sex_x_age_x_fare` and strongly correlates with lower survival rates in the Titanic dataset.

Prediction for row 16: did not survive
Top SHAP features: cabin, ticket, fare

LLM SHAP interpretation for row 16 (English):
The passenger did not survive because the SHAP feature importances indicate that their **cabin**, **ticket**, and **fare** were the most influential factors. These features likely reflected a lower-class cabin (possibly in a less survivable section), a ticket associated with a less favorable condition, and a fare that aligned with a lower social class, all contributing to the negative survival prediction.

Plausibility triples: sex_x_fare_x_cabin, sex_x_age_x_fare, sex_x_parch_x_fare

LLM Dempster interpretation for row 16 (English):
The passenger did not survive due to a combination of factors: being male (sex), lower ticket class (pclass), older age, and likely lower fare (fare), which align with historical survival patterns where males in lower classes had reduced survival chances. These factors (certainty triples and plausibility triples) collectively indicate a high likelihood of not surviving.

Prediction for row 17: did not survive
Top SHAP features: fare, age, cabin

LLM SHAP interpretation for row 17 (English):
The passenger did not survive due to high fare, older age, and the cabin's condition, as these were the top SHAP features influencing the prediction.

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the famous ship.
Each row represents a passenger and includes variables such as ticket class
(`pclass`), sex, age, number of siblings/spouses (`sibsp`) and parents/

Plausibility triples: age_x_ticket_x_fare, age_x_fare_x_cabin, age_x_sibsp_x_fare

LLM Dempster interpretation for row 17 (English):
The passenger did not survive due to being male (sex), in the lowest class (pclass), and older (age), which are strong indicators of lower survival probability, compounded by a lower fare (sex_x_age_x_fare). These factors align with historical survival trends where males, especially older individuals in lower classes, had reduced survival chances.

Prediction for row 18: survived
Top SHAP features: age, fare, cabin

LLM SHAP interpretation for row 18 (English):
The passenger survived primarily due to high fare, the presence of a cabin, and their age, as these top SHAP features indicate significant contributions to the survival prediction. Higher fare and cabin attributes likely reflect better class or conditions, while age (possibly within a favorable range) supported the survival outcome.

Plausibility triples: age_x_sibsp_x_fare, age_x_fare_x_cabin, age_x_ticket_x_fare

LLM Dempster interpretation for row 18 (English):
The passenger survived because they were female (sex), in first class (pclass), and young (age), which are certainty factors.
