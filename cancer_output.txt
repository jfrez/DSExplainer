Prompt 204:

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains numerical measurements of cell nuclei obtained from digitized images of breast tissue biopsies. Each observation corresponds to a tumor and includes features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and concavity, among others. Each sample is labeled as either malignant or benign.

Objective: 
Write a single descriptive paragraph that explains whether the tumor is malignant or benign, based on the Certainty and Plausibility metrics.
Focus on the most influential feature combinations with high certainty or plausibility scores, and refer to specific input values when relevant.
Use a technical and concise tone. Do not include bullet points or section titles.
Conclude with a clear statement on the tumor’s classification (e.g., 'The tumor is predicted to be benign.').
