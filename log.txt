The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the famous ship.
Each row represents a passenger and includes variables such as ticket class
(`pclass`), sex, age, number of siblings/spouses (`sibsp`) and parents/
children (`parch`) aboard, the fare paid, cabin, and embarkation port. The
target variable is `survived`, indicating whether the passenger lived.

Objective: briefly conclude why the passenger survived or not. Only provide the final conclusion based on SHAP feature importances.
Columns: pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked
Prediction for row 15: survived
Top SHAP features: age, fare, ticket

LLM SHAP interpretation for row 15 (English):
The passenger survived primarily due to the positive contributions of the top SHAP features: **age**, **fare**, and **ticket**. These features indicate that the passenger was likely younger, paid a higher fare (suggesting a higher-class ticket), and held a ticket associated with improved survival outcomes, as per the model's SHAP importance analysis.

Plausibility triples: age_x_fare_x_cabin, age_x_ticket_x_fare, age_x_parch_x_fare

LLM Dempster interpretation for row 16 (English):
The passenger did not survive due to being male (sex), in a lower ticket class (pclass), older, and paying a lower fare, which aligns with historical patterns where males in lower classes and older passengers had reduced survival chances. These factors (certainty triples: sex_x_age_x_fare, pclass_x_sex_x_age) and plausibility (age_x_fare_x_cabin) strongly indicate poor survival likelihood.

Prediction for row 17: survived
Top SHAP features: age, fare, cabin

LLM SHAP interpretation for row 17 (English):
The passenger survived primarily due to the influence of the top SHAP features: **age**, **fare**, and **cabin**. Higher **fare** (indicating a more luxurious class) and the presence of a **cabin** (suggesting a higher-class ticket) likely contributed to survival, while **age** (possibly a younger passenger) also played a role. These factors collectively strengthened the model's prediction of survival.

LLM Dempster interpretation for row 17 (English):
The passenger survived due to a combination of factors from certainty and plausibility triples: **high class (pclass)**, **female sex**, and **higher fare** (certainty triples), which are strongly associated with survival. Additionally, **age and fare** (plausibility triples) further support this outcome, indicating wealth and social status that likely contributed to survival.

Prediction for row 18: did not survive
Top SHAP features: age, cabin, fare

LLM SHAP interpretation for row 18 (English):
The passenger did not survive primarily due to the negative contributions of their age, cabin, and fare. Higher age and lower fare (indicating potentially lower-class travel) are associated with reduced survival chances, while the cabin's class (likely lower) further contributed to the poor outcome. These factors, as highlighted by SHAP feature importances, collectively influenced the prediction of non-survival.
